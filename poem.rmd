      And the mome raths outgrabe.

## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem you created using chatGPT of 20 to 30 lines,here!-->
Beneath the veil of silver skies,  
Where stars like ancient embers glow,  
The quiet winds of midnight rise,  
To sing of dreams we used to know.  

The trees, in shadows softly swayed,  
Hold secrets whispered long ago,  
Of fleeting love, of hearts betrayed,  
Of rivers where the moonlight flows.  

A lonely owl with haunted eyes,  
Calls to the silence, deep and wide,  
While fireflies in fleeting flight,  
Dance like the souls that never died.
